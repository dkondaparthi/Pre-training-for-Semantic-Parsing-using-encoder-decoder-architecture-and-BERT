Instructions to run the code:

1. Extract the submitted zip file.
2. To create vocabulary for neural models i.e TSP we need GloVe Embeddings. 
So download embedding from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ site with 6B tokens i.e glove6B.zip and save the file in /data/glove/ folder.
3. Run the python file run.py

This should slowly start running the files. Please note that modela architectures are very large so it will take long term before observing any result.
